  <introparagraph class="introparagraph">One of the major problems is the desire for the company to not be left behind with rapidly changing technology. Each generation of products has a bridge to the last generation, but should you miss the boat, you leave your company at risk when it comes time to migrate. I’ve project managed several technology conversions for large enterprises. There is an opportunity in having a project manager who is present in the proposal process, active in the contract negotiation, responsible for the project management & can follow up on the after action to provide conclusive reporting on the KPI’s that were promised as well as the KPI’s that were actually delivered.</introparagraph>
